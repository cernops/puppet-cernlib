CERN extensions for puppet
==========================

This is a collection of some CERN-specific puppet extensions, that don't belong
in any other particular module. Almost certainly not applicable externally.

Hardware vendor lookup
----------------------

Consult the CERN hardware database to find the vendor (or more accurately, the
company that is responsible for maintenance).

$vendor = cern_hwvendor()


Egroup expansion
----------------

Expand CERN egroups in manifests.

Rerurns an array of usernames following the expansion of an
     egroup. Three arguments must be specified. The first is the egroup
     name. The second is format parameter, e.g. %u@CERN.CH.
     The third is true or false depending if you want to recurse
     egroups. Example:
       egroupexpand('ai-admins','%u@CERN.CH',true)
     will return an array ['straylen@CERN.CH','mccance@CERN.CH']

Load class if exists
--------------------

Loads a class if the class is available.
